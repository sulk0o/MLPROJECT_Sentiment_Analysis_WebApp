# MLPROJECT_Sentiment_Analysis_WebApp
Created 9/14/24, first ML project, wanted to clean data, train a very basic model, and deploy locally to use. This project was coded completely by me, except the index.html file in templates. This was generated with chatGPT, as I do not know html, and am lazy. The purpose of this project was to simply get a dataset, clean it, train a basic model on it, and deploy it locally for me to test. This is my first ever ML project of some sort. The testing ipynb file was to test a few different sklearn models to see which ones worked better. Overall, a logistic regression model seemed to work best for the dataset, and I used L1 regularization to fight overfitting. This reduced the model accurazy from 89% to 87% suggesting there might have been some overfitting going on.
